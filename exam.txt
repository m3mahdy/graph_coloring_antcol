using a genetic algorithm, with many examples

1- how to extract children from parent using different crossover methods, and also the same for crossover with permutations,

2- solution representation, objective function, crossover and mutation for

- quatratic assignment problem

- facility location problem

- set covering

- set partitioning problem

want many examples for them with problem explanations and how to solve it using genetic algorithm, and the common application for each type of these 4 categories of the problems, similarities between them, and what the application may be confusing between them and how to differentiate between them, and deep explanation for everything
